# ACM Library Information Scanner

Introducing an app that extracts with a single click the information needed to record the content of an article in the ACM Library and copies it to the clipboard in the appropriate markdown format!

With this app, you can easily extract the information you need from ACM Library web pages, such as author name, article title, publisher, date, DOI, etc., and copy it to the clipboard. No more copying and pasting each piece of information separately!

If you are a student, researcher, or frequent user of the ACM Library, this app will be a great help in taking notes about the articles you read. Please give it a try and find out how it can make your life easier!
